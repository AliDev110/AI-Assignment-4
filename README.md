# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

The goal is to find optimal routes for multiple vehicles visiting a set of locations. (When there's only one vehicle, it reduces to the Traveling Salesperson Problem). For our scenario, the “optimal route” will refer to the routes with the least total distance for all our vehicles combined.

You can find all the code in a single file (VRP.ipynb) along with a visual representation of the problem.
